# Factory Downtime Analysis using Tableau

This project was completed as part of the Deloitte Virtual Internship on Forage. The goal was to analyze telemetry data collected from four global factories and identify which locations and devices experienced the most downtime.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Tableau
- JSON (telemetry data)
- Calculated Fields
- Data Visualization

## 📝 Project Overview
Daikibo, a global manufacturing company, collected telemetry data every 10 minutes from 9 machine types across 4 factories for one month (May 2021). This project involved:

- Creating a calculated field (`Unhealthy`) to identify potential machine breakdowns.
- Visualizing total downtime per factory.
- Visualizing downtime per device type.
- Building an interactive Tableau dashboard using filter actions.

## 📊 Deliverables
- Tableau Dashboard (screenshot or .twbx file)
- Bar Chart: Downtime per Factory
- Bar Chart: Downtime per Device Type
- Interactive filtering between factory and device charts

## 📌 Key Insights
- Identified the factory with the most machine downtime.
- Pinpointed specific device types contributing to delays.
